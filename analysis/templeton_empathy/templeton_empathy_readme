This folder contains all R scripts to clean and analyze data from Canada, China, Jordan, South Africa, Turkey, and the US in years 1 and 2 of the Templeton project.
Qualtrics data files are owned and shared by Jean Decety. Dropbox files are owned and shared by Jason Cowell. Other data files are on the deectylab server (ssdfiles.uchicago.edu\decetylab)
Data for each child are coded with a unique ID, a composite of the country and oiginal subject ID. 

calculate_QCAE.Rmd calculates QCAE scores for parents and children and writes them into "templeton_qcae_calculations.csv."
QCAE calculations are based off of descriptions in decetylab\projects\research\CrossCulturalMoralDevelopment\Questionnaires\QCAE\QCAE_scoring.pdf
The script reads in the following files:
- Consolidated Questionnaire - English - CA_June 3, 2020_15.27.csv (raw output from "Consolidated Questionnaire - English -CA" Qualtrics survey)
- Parent QCAE - China_June 3, 2020_15.11 (raw output from "Parent QCAE - China" Qualtrics survey)
- QCAE- China_June 3, 2020_15.15 (raw output from "QCAE- China" Qualtrics survey)
- South Africa - All Questionnaires_June 3, 2020_15.35 (raw output from "South Africa - All Questionnaires_June 3, 2020_15.35" Qualtrics survey)
- USA- All Questionnaires_June 3, 2020_15.34 (raw output from "USA- All Questionnaires" Qualtrics survey)
- Turkish_3-5years_merged_data_for_chicago_v1.csv (conversion to csv of Turkish_3-5years_merged_data_for_chicago_v1.sav on Dropbox under CCMD Merge Data/Countries/Turkey/SPSS/Full)
- Turkish_6-12years_merged_data_for_chicago_v1.csv (conversion to csv of Turkish_6-12years_merged_data_for_chicago_v1.sav on Dropbox under CCMD Merge Data/Countries/Turkey/SPSS/Full)
Note: The calculations for the Turkish data assume that scores were entered so that 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = slightly disagree, 3 = slightly agree, and 4 = strongly agree. It assumes that no reverse-scoring was done during data entry.

calculate_age.Rmd calculates ages in months and years based on the following files on the decetylab server. All files were first manually converted to .csv format.
